Hello beautiful person, my name is 
    Jo√£o Victor Fernandes and this is my
    first project. I decided to post it on 
    GitHub so that I and other people who 
    enter my profile can see my progress. 
    It's also my question, after all,
    I can't forget where I came from.

Well, this project was done in JS
    and I always do a yarn install
    before running it on my devices
    or emulators. I recommend you do the same.

I can't forget who had the idea of doing this
    project and who taught me how to do it. Even if this 
    person won't read it, I'll leave the link with your video below:

Sorry for my poor English and that's it :)
